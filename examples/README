==============================================================================
1. Hidden Markov Model                                           *hmm*

1. Go to the casino_hmm folder
 
cd casino_hmm

2. Run the train program. 

train -c casino_bw_train.txt > casino_reestimated_bw.txt

3. See the results

more casino_reestimated_bw.txt


** Simulating  HMM

1. Go to the casino_hmm folder:

cd casino_hmm

2. Run the simulate program:

simulate -m casino.txt -n 1 -l 100 -h

** Decoding a HMM using viterbi                            

1. Go the casino_hmm folder:

cd casino_hmm

2. Run the viterbi_decoding program

viterbi_decoding -m casino.txt < input.txt 

==============================================================================
2. Independent Identically Distributed Model                        *iid*

1. Go to the discreteiid folder

cd discreteiid

2. Run the train program

train -c train.txt

==============================================================================
5. Inhomogeneous Markov Chain                          *wam*

1. Go to the wam folder

cd wam

2. Execute the train program

train -c train.txt > trained_wam.txt

3. See the results

more trained_wam.txt

==============================================================================
6. Variable Length Markov Chain                        *vlmc*

1. Go to the vlmc folder

cd vlmc

2. execute the train program

train -c train_vlmc.txt > trained_vlmc.txt

3. see the results

more trained_vlmc.txt

4. simulating

simulate -m trained_vlmc.txt -l 100 -n 5

==============================================================================
7. Bayesian Classifiers                                            *bayes*

Example of Bayesian Classifier configuration file:

classes=("honest": "honest_dice_markov_chain.txt";  
         "loaded": "loaded_dice_markov_chain.txt")
model_probabilities=("loaded": 0.1;  
                     "honest": 0.9)

Executing bayesian classifier: 

1. Go the casino_markov_chain folder

cd casino_markov_chain 

2. Run the bayes_classifier program


bayes_classifier -c bayes_classifier.txt  < sequences.in 
 
==============================================================================
8. Generalized Hidden Markov Model                     *ghmm*

1. Go the bacteria_ghmm directory

cd bacteria_ghmm

2.  Run the train program

train -c cfg/train_transitions.cfg > ghmm_estimated.txt 

3. See the results

more ghmm_estimated.txt

4. Run the viterbi

viterbi -m ghmm_estimated < test_set/seq > output.txt

5. Check the accuracy

./scripts/accuracy.pl  test_set/path output.txt
